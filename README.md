# rusty_unix_cp
A rust implementation of the Unix cp command, albeit a much simpler version. The command is capable copying standalone files or recursively copying directories to a target location in the filesystem. On Unix-like systems, you may pass file globs as an argument too!

## Note
This project primarily served as a way to get more familiar with the rust programming language and the features provided by the standard library.
